# Welcome to my Drum Machine!

Full list of used technologies: Typescript, React, Redux, Styled-components, Jest, react-slick, axios, redux-thunk, react-loader, fontawesome.

While creating this project, I was inspired by the desire to combine my love for music and programming. I tried to use the KISS and DRY principles, I learned more about the structure of the application, unit testing, optimization, refactoring, working with media data, etc.
